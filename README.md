  # Steps
  I started with my portfolio generator code built during lesson 9 and removed some unnecessary location links and html templates then updated the questions to reflect those needed for this project, and updated/added the necessary functions to both index.js and page-template.js to function as needed. I then added bootstrap and google fonts and added some fun css elements.
